# Vacation

## Types

There're two types of vacation days: Paid and unpaid.
* Paid vacation: 25 days per year by default. (Excl. public holidays and weekends)
* Unpaid vacation: Unpaid vacation can be negotiated with the company if the paid vacations are not sufficient due to any reason.

## Overview

Generally speaking, everyone is entitled to 25 days' paid vacation per year. In other words, 25/12 days per month. The vacation days during the first year are considered as loan, which will be canceled after 4 years in service.

Everyone can save 5 vacation days each year. The rest days will be automatically paid out as compensation. It is important to take 20 days' vacation for those who has been working a full year, due to the regulation from Swedish migration board.

## In practice

The counting vacations period is from April 1st to March 31st next year.

You can treat the vacation as earning 25/12 days per month. And vacation days can be borrowed in advanced if they are not earned yet.

Assuming this year is 2022, and now we are in July.

* Sam starts his employment in February 2022, so he has saved **(25/12) x 2** earned days from "last year", and has earned **(25/12) x 4** days "this year".
* Lucy starts her employment in October 2021, and she has taken 11 days vacations already, so she has saved **(25/12) x 6 - 11** earned days from "last year", and has earned **(25/12) x 4** days "this year".
* Tom starts his employment in June 2021, and he has taken 22 days vacations already, so he has used all **(25/12) x 10** earned days from "last year", and has earned **(25/12) x (10+4) - 22** days so far.
* Harry starts his employment December 2021, and he has taken 20 vacations already, among which, **(25/12) x 8** are earned and **20 - (25/12) x 8** days are "borrowed" in advanced.

When taking earned vacation days, the payment will be higher than normal working days.
When taking borrowed vacation days, the payment will be the same as normal working days.

* Earned days: You will earn 25/12 days per month, i.e. 25 days per year.
* Saved days: They are the earned days from former years, and you can save up to 5 days per year.
* Borrowed days: The vacation days you haven't earned yet, but can still take the vacations as borrowed days in advance.
