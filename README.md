Here is the onboarding information and useful materials to help new family members get into new life smoothly.


## Work Permit

* We have the fast track with Swedish Migration Board, and will support you with work permit.
* The materials that you need to prepare for the visa application: (only need scancopy or photocopy)
  - Passport (the page showing your personal information and valid period, etc.)
  - If your passport is about to expire, please extend it in advance. It is better to have a passport valid for two years at least.
  - If you have visited Sweden in the past 12 months, please provide a copy of the entry & exit stamp page of your passport, along with a copy of your Schengen visa.
  - If you have ever had a residence permit in any country other than Sweden, please provide a copy of it.
  - If you apply together with your spouse, please provide your marriage certificate.
  - If you apply with your kids, please provide the birth certificate.
* Application materials are only accepted in English. Any other languages should be translated by a professional translation agency and notarized by a notary office.
* Usually the processing time of the work permit is about 10 working days.
* After the residence permit is submitted, you can go to the Swedish Embassy or Consulate in your country to leave fingerprints. Remember to bring your passport and case number (or control number) with you.
* Once the work permit card is ready, it will be sent from the Migration Board in Sweden to the embassy or consulate in your country within two weeks. You can pick it up in person or authorize someone to fetch it on your behalf.


## Preparation before departure 

* Keep the decision letter from the Swedish Migration Board.
* Make sure your flight departure date is within the valid period of your visa.
* Passport & work permit card

* Kid's birth certificate & legalized translation if have kids
* Some cash in Swedish Krona (10000 SEK should be enough, and double it if you have family together with you)
