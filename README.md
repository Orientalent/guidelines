Here is the onboarding information and useful materials to help new family members get into new life smoothly.


## Visa application

* The company has fast track in Swedish Immigration Agency. Work permit visa can be issued within 45 days, and the current pass rate is 100%.
* The company can help your visa application through our partner: Swedish professional visa service agency.
* 6 materials that you need to prepare before filling out the visa application: (You only need to scan or photograph the following materials in electronic version, no need to mail the original documents)

1. Passport (the page showing your personal information, passport validity period)
2. If your passport is about to expire, please extend your passport in advance. The work permit is limited to the validity period of the passport, and your validity period of the passport shuld be more than two years.
3. If you have visited Sweden in the past 12 months, please provide a copy of the exit stamp/exit stamp page of your passport, along with a copy of your Schengen visa.
4. If you have ever had a residence permit in any country other than Sweden, please provide a copy of it.
5. If you want to bring your spouse to Sweden, please provide the original marriage certificate with the notarized translation.
6. If you want to bring your child to Sweden, please provide the child's birth certificate with the notarized translation.

* Application materials are only accepted in English. Any Chinese materials should be translated by a professional translation agency and notarized by a local notary office.
* After receiving the above documents, our visa service agency will check and submit the application to the Swedish Immigration Agency.
* The processing time of the visa is about 10 working days (the processing time may be extended when the Swedish Immigration Agency requires the applicant to submit additional documents or the visa officer is understaffed).
* After the residence permit is approved, you need to go to the Swedish Embassy in China (Beijing) or the Swedish Consulate General in Shanghai to collect fingerprints. You can make an appointment with the embassy before your visit to avoid waiting in line. When collecting information, you need to bring your visa application number, immigration decision letter and passport.
* Once the visa residence card is ready, it will be mailed from the Swedish Migration Agency to the embassy or consulate in four weeks. You can pick it up in person or authorize your relatives or friends to pick it up on your behalf.


## Preparation before departure 

* Keep the digital decision letter from the Swedish Immigration Agency.
* Please check the validity period of your visa carefully to ensure that the date of your flight ticket is within the validity period of your visa.
* The documents that you need to bring with you are passport, visa & work permit card, marriage certificate with notarized translation, child's birth certificate with notarized translation.
* Some cash in Swedish Krona (20000 SEK should be more than enough, and double it if you have family together with you)
* A visa/master card can be used globally. Preferably IC-based, since there a few places that magnetic tape-based cards cannot be used.
* Enable the global communication function(international roaming)from your mobile subscription in case you need it before getting company smart phone.
* Luggage preparation: for people who are afraid of the cold weather can bring a thick down jacket.
